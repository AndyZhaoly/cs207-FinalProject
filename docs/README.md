## Note for Graders

Please grade files with the extension `.md`, and ignore miles with the `.tex.md` extension. We use [TeXify](https://github.com/agurodriguez/github-texify) to render math equations in LaTeX written into our markdown files. This app takes in files with the `.tex.md` extension and outputs files with the `.md` extension.

For example, for Milestone 1, please ignore `milestone1.tex.md` and instead grade `milestone1.md`.

**Image Holding Folders**

For every milestone or other document, an `*_image/` folder corresponding to the document will be created to store any images that are used by that document.

For example, `m1_image/` contains the images used by `milestone1.md`. In particular, the image of the computational graph used as a worked example is stored in this folder.

**tex/ Folder**

The `tex/` folder is used by TeXify to store the images generated by parsing any LaTeX in our `*.tex.md` files.
